                <h3>About This Assessment</h3>
                <p>This quiz is based on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), which categorizes personalities into 16 distinct types. You'll answer questions that explore four key dimensions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Energy Direction:</strong> Extraversion (E) vs Introversion (I)</li>
                    <li><strong>Information Processing:</strong> Sensing (S) vs Intuition (N)</li>
                    <li><strong>Decision Making:</strong> Thinking (T) vs Feeling (F)</li>
                    <li><strong>Lifestyle Approach:</strong> Judging (J) vs Perceiving (P)</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>Take your time with each question and choose the answer that feels most natural to you. There are no right or wrong answers - only insights into your unique personality!</p>
